Next up:
- Make author index
- Remove subreddit column from authors list
- Add util function to go from current dataset to required format
- What to do with string length (reduce to > 20? in remove_authors, or straight at download?)
- Re-try testing (with toy tfrec)

Longer term:
- Change package name
- Viz helper for training
- Add gradient accumulation option?
- Add maximize distance between negative and anchor to loss?
- Rerun baseline models
    - Non fine-tuned BERT
    - Simple classifier
    - FFN with increasing complexity

Other:
- Rerun fine-tuning
    - Margin
    - Grad accumulation
    - Loss function
    - Model type
- Any manipulation needed for the optimizer?
- Should loss consider distance from average of anchor encodings, or average distance from each anchor encoding?
