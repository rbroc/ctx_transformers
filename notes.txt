# UP NEXT

Split utils for:
- Dataset building
- TFRecord?
- Computations of sort?
- Preprocessing

# Refactor dataset/preprocessing (start from already refactored)
    - Add id to each example
    - Expand nr users
    - Reverse dataset at save
    - More years/data

# Edit tfrecord for new data format

# Quick try on notebook to make sure strategy works

LONGER TERM
- Check dependencies
- Develop viz module
- Change package name
- Make dockerfile
- Add gradient accumulation?
- Add to loss distance between n and anch
- Rerun baseline model with new scripts

Notes: 
- Margin, grad accumulation, model type as manipulations
- No room for optimizer in file naming protocol!
- Tolerance for difference in tests set to 5e-7
- In FFN anchor is averaged
- Average distance from all encodings removed
