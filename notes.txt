- Add reset to name
- Look at weights
- Run large dataset training
- Clean up the code

Further:
- Run with larger dataset for more epochs
- Classifier for triplet loss
- Evaluation on aggregates
- Probably make json subfolder for triplet too

ENH
- Log padding parameters somewhere?
- Change package name
- Viz helpers for training
- Rerun FFN model

Other triplet:
- Rerun fine-tuning
    - Loss function
    - Model type
- Any manipulation needed for the optimizer?
- Should loss consider distance from average of anchor encodings, or average distance from each anchor encoding?
- Add maximize distance between negative and anchor to loss?
- Should we consider limiting string length
