# UP NEXT
# Rerun preprocessing
# More years of data?
# Try on colab to make sure strategy works

LONGER TERM
- Check dependencies / setup.py
- Develop viz module
- Change package name
- Edit dockerfile
- Add gradient accumulation?
- Add to loss distance between n and anch?
- Rerun baseline model with new scripts

Notes: 
- Margin, grad accumulation, model type as manipulations
- No room for optimizer in file naming protocol!
- Tolerance for difference in tests set to 5e-7
- Average distance from all encodings removed
