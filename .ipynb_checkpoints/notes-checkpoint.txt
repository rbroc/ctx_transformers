# CHECK:
- That the way the model updates is correct
    - E.g., make copies of layers, concatenate better, etc.
    - Or rely on HF updates?
- Make masking easier?


# THEN
- Try with different optimizers - in progress, but e.g., increase LR on Adam
- Try other MLM protocols
    - Skip connection concat
    - Add one attention layer
    - Other
    - Previous + concatenate?
- Classifier for triplet loss
- Evaluation on aggregates
- Probably make json subfolder for triplet too

ENH
- Change package name
- Viz helpers for training
- Rerun FFN model

Triplet note:
- Rerun fine-tuning
    - Loss function
    - Model type
- Any manipulation needed for the optimizer?
- Should loss consider distance from average of anchor encodings, or average distance from each anchor encoding?
- Add maximize distance between negative and anchor to loss?
