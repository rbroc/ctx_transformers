TO DO
- Set up network and training for TFIDF
- Run trained on test
- Redo embeddings for more
- Benchmark MLMs

MLM
- Align MLMs single and non single
- Baseline triplet for single
- Benchmark MLM
- Make overview of MLM and triplet

Tuesday on
- Run jiant +  baselines
- Run all benchmarks on MLM (pre- + post-agg)
    - MLM
    - Triplet
    - Tweteval
    - STS
    - Personality
    - Discoeval + Jiant
    - Reddit/Twitter/Yelp
- Check MLM biencoders training
- Move models to MLM folder
- Sentence tasks with context aggregation, no training

Recap:
- Small advantage on the personality tasks
- Pretty much none for STS, Discoeval, YELP, Reddit, Twitter (double-check)

*** Conceptual guide ***

Goal 1: Make reddit dataset available on huggingface
Goal 2: Wrap up triplet paper (dataset for self-supervised)
Goal 3: MLM paper

Paper 1, triplet:
    - Text as person encoder
    - Exploring this idea through triplet loss
    - Many downstream tasks, lacking datasets

Paper 2, MLM
    - Compare MLM performance
    - Compare triplet performance
    - Compare other benchmarks
    - TODO: single models
